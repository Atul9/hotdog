= Hotdog!

Hotdog is a syslog-to-Kafka forwarder which aims to get log entries into
link:https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka]
as quickly as possible.

== Configuration

Hotdog is configured by the `hotdog.yml` file, which has a very fluid syntax at
the moment. The two main sections are the `global` and `rules` blocks.

=== Global

The `global` configuration block helps configure `hotdog` itself, namely the
port it listens on, etc.

=== Rules

Hotdog's rules define how it should handle and route the syslog messages it
receives.

== Development

Hotdog is tested against the latest Rust stable. A simple `cargo build` should
compile a working `hotdog` binary for your platform.


On Linux systems it is easy to test with:

[source,bash]
----
logger --server 127.0.0.1  -T -P 1514 "hello world"
----
