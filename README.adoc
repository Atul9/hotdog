= Hotdog!

Hotdog is a syslog-to-Kafka forwarder which aims to get log entries into
link:https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka]
as quickly as possible.

Hotdog is configured by the `hotdog.yml` file, which has a very fluid syntax at
the moment.


== Development

Hotdog is tested against the latest Rust stable. A simple `cargo build` should
compile a working `hotdog` binary for your platform.


On Linux systems it is easy to test with:

[source,bash]
----
logger --server 127.0.0.1  -T -P 1514 "hello world"
----
